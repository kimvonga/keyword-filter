# keyword-filter
Filters .pdf for particular keywords. Written in .ipynb. Project requested by Minh

3/1/2021 - v 1.0.0
Updated functions to use the class Transcript() and moved functions to keyword_lib.py.
Restructured notebook to read all .pdf files in a given directory and then created a widget allowing the user
  to select which file to process. Widget also displays the report as a table.
Removed save/export, will think about putting it back in as a button.
